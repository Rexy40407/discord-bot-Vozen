// tests/claimHelp.test.ts — the buyer asks us to activate a purchase by hand (plan 036 F3+).
//
// Why this exists, and why it carries the EMAIL: a stuck buyer's purchase must be found in the
// Ko-fi seller panel by hand, because Ko-fi never sends the order in the webhook after the fact.
// The receipt's `Ref: S-…` looked like the handle — but Ko-fi's transaction search only matches
// by NAME or EMAIL (verified 2026-07-17 against the live seller panel), so the Ref is useless to
// the owner. The email the buyer used is what the owner can actually paste and find. It is NOT
// proof of ownership (plan 021) — it is a lookup hint; the owner still confirms the paid order and
// grants by hand. This module turns (Discord ID, Ko-fi email) into that notification.
