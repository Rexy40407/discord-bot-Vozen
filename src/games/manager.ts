 * would scramble the audio. Board games (pure text, future Wave 3) may

 *  - per-guild lock (start refuses if there is already a game);
 *  - route messages from the game's CHANNEL to the match (and signal "consumed"
 *    to the handler, which then does NOT read the message aloud);
 *  - own the session's timers and ALWAYS CANCEL THEM at the end (the classic
 *    ghost-timer bug: the AloneWatcher now leaves immediately when the channel empties,
 *    so a match can be aborted mid-way — endGuild handles that);
 *  - persist the points on a NORMAL end (end); discard on a FORCED end (stop/endGuild).
 *
