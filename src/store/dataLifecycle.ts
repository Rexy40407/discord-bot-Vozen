// Data lifecycle for COMPLIANCE (GDPR / Discord Developer Policy §5(b)): two
// operations — purge the data of a SERVER that removed the bot, and erase ALL of a
// USER's data (right to be forgotten).
//
// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the 4 lists below categorize each table. A new table with
// `guild_id`/`user_id` MUST go into one of them — otherwise `dataLifecycle.test.ts`
// (rot-guard) FAILS. The purge/erase vs. RETAINED distinction is not derivable from the
// schema (a financial table has `user_id` all the same), so it is explicit and hand-reviewed.
