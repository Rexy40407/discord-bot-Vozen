// PURE logic of the CLAIM: the buyer claims a pending Ko-fi purchase (that arrived without a
// Discord ID, see store/kofiPending.ts) by entering the transaction CODE from the receipt — a
// strong key that only they have. The Discord identity comes already validated by OAuth (the
// endpoint calls statusApi.resolveIdentity BEFORE this), so here we trust the `discordId`. Applies
// the grant, marks the pending one claimed and memorizes email->Discord ID (future renewals
// resolve themselves). No network IO; testable in isolation.

/**
 * Claims a pending Ko-fi purchase. The `input` must be the transaction CODE from the Ko-fi receipt
 * (a strong key that only the buyer has). An `input` of the EMAIL type (contains '@') is REJECTED with
 * `use_receipt_code` without touching the DB — the email is NOT accepted as proof of ownership: it is not a secret,
 * and any logged-in Discord account that knew it could claim someone else's Premium
 * during the pending grant's 90-day retention (see "## Decision" in plan 021). The
 * Discord identity comes already validated by OAuth. Applies to the `discordId` ALL the pending
 * purchases of the SAME email (orphan renewals), marks them claimed and memorizes email->Discord ID
 * (future renewals resolve automatically). The operation is transactional and single-use.

/**
 * Ko-fi hides the transaction code inside the receipt's own URL, in two different shapes:
 *   Shop item (annual):   ko-fi.com/summary/<code>            — code is last
 *   Membership (monthly): .../coffeeshop?txid=<code>&mode=g   — code is in the MIDDLE
 * On the monthly one, selecting from after `txid=` to the end of the address hands the buyer
 * the code with `&mode=g` welded on; pasting that used to return "no purchase found" on a
 * purchase they had genuinely paid for. So: pull the code out of whatever they paste — the
 * bare code, the code plus trailing junk, or the whole URL.
 *
 * If the input holds no UUID we return it untouched, so a Ko-fi transaction id that is not
 * UUID-shaped keeps working exactly as before. This only ever widens what we accept; the code
 * still has to MATCH a pending row to claim anything, so it grants no new access.
