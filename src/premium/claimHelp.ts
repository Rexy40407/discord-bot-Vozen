// The buyer asks us to activate a purchase by hand (plan 036).
//
// WHY IT CARRIES THE EMAIL, and why this is not an automatic activation: when a buyer cannot
// activate, the owner has to find the order in the Ko-fi seller panel and grant by hand — Ko-fi
// offers no API to look an order up (webhook-only), so this is inherently manual. The receipt's
// `Ref: S-…` looked like the handle, but Ko-fi's transaction search matches only by NAME or EMAIL
// (verified 2026-07-17 against the live seller panel), so the Ref is useless to the owner. The
// email the buyer used is what the owner can paste into that search and find the order with.
//
// The email is NOT proof of ownership (that path was rejected in plan 021 — the email is not a
// secret). It is a LOOKUP HINT for a human: the owner still opens Ko-fi, confirms the paid order,
// and grants manually. Nothing here activates anything. Only (Discord ID, email) leaves — no pass,
// no product, nothing else we hold. The Discord identity arrives already validated by OAuth.
