// Invitation to VOTE as a Plus upsell (growth loop). A localized line that offers
// 24h of free Plus for a vote on top.gg — attached at the moments when a FREE user
// is already being upsold (serverstats, pronunciation limit, /premium). It is NOT a
// new gate nor a DM: it only enriches responses that already exist. Without a configured
// clientId it returns null (the link would be broken, top.gg/bot//vote) and the caller attaches nothing.
