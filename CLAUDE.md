# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working on Vozen (Discord TTS bot).

## Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Build (typecheck + emit): `npm run build` (tsc)
- Typecheck the tests too: `npm run typecheck` (tsc over `src/` + `tests/`, no emit)
- Tests: `npx vitest run` (suite in `tests/`)
- Dev (watch mode): `npm run dev`
- Production: `npm run start:prod` — NEVER plain `npm start` in production:
  it skips the supervisor `scripts/start-prod.mjs` (single-instance lock,
  native-module preheat, auto-restart with backoff, persistent logs).

## Hard rules

- **Discord compliance is mandatory** (Developer ToS + Developer Policy — audit
  2026-07-11 in `docs/PLAN-DISCORD-COMPLIANCE.md`). Every new feature must respect:
  - API data is used ONLY for the declared functionality; no profiling, no sale,
    no sharing with third parties (disclosed TTS engines excepted), no AI training
    on message content.
  - Any user-facing data the bot stores must be disclosed in PRIVACY.md AND have
    a user-accessible deletion path (command).
  - Anything acting on/about a user (recording, DMs, account changes) requires
    that user's explicit prior consent (see voice clone: consent-first pattern).
  - No unsolicited DMs, ever. No contacting users outside Discord with API data.
  - Paid features must support Discord Premium Apps purchase with price parity
    (≤ other channels) wherever Discord monetization is available to the app.
  - Suspected unauthorized data access → notify Discord and affected users
    immediately (see docs/INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md once it exists).
  - Growth gate: BEFORE ~75 servers, the app must pass verification + Message
    Content intent review.
- NEVER run `npm audit fix --force`. It would downgrade discord.js to v13 and
  @discordjs/opus across a major. Transitive CVEs are handled by the
  `overrides` block in `package.json` — read the `//overrides` comment there
  before touching any dependency version.
- Code comments in this repo are written in Portuguese. Write new comments in
  Portuguese too.
- Never read or commit `.env`. Use `.env.example` as the reference.
- NEVER edit file _content_ with PowerShell `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` (or
  `-replace` pipelines) on this repo. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads UTF-8-without-BOM
  as Windows-1252 and rewrites it corrupted (mojibake: `€`→`â‚¬`, emojis/acentos
  broken). Use the Edit/Write tools instead. `tools/minify-site.mjs` has a
  mojibake guard that fails `npm run build:site` if this slips through.
- **Site RGPD/GDPR: sem terceiros sem consentimento.** O site (`site/`) é
  auto-suficiente por design — fontes servidas de `assets/fonts/` (self-hosted),
  zero cookies, zero analytics/trackers, e a CSP das páginas só permite `'self'`
  (+ `cdn.discordapp.com` para avatares e `api.vozen.org` para a API). Adicionar
  Google Fonts, analytics, píxeis, iframes ou qualquer recurso de terceiro que
  transmita o IP do visitante **exige consentimento prévio** (banner/CMP) — não o
  adiciones sem esse gate, e mantém a CSP apertada. A política em
  `site/privacy.html` (Art. 13 do RGPD) reflete a instância oficial (gTTS→Google,
  STT Premium, clone NÃO oferecido no host) — se mudares o que o site recolhe,
  atualiza-a.

## Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`; fill `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`.
- The sharding variable is `BOT_SHARDS`, deliberately NOT `SHARDS` —
  `SHARDS`/`SHARD_COUNT` are read from the environment by the discord.js
  Client itself and would break single-process `npm start`. Do not rename it.
- `TTS_ENGINE=neural` requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` (the bot fails fast without
  it). The default engine is `piper` (self-hosted, free).

## Architecture

- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — it reflects the code in `src/`. The historical
  design spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/` may diverge; the code wins.
- Optional voice-clone sidecar (Chatterbox, Python): installed by
  `tools/setup-clone.ps1` into `tools/clone-venv/` (gitignored). The bot
  auto-detects it (`resolveCloneCmd`: `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows OR
  `bin/python` on Linux). **Needs GPU/RAM** — it does not even load on the
  hosted VPS (2 vCPU, 3.7 GB; OOMs at ~3.3 GB — see `docs/SPIKE-CLONE.md`).
  So the `/voice clone` command group is **hidden by default**; set
  `CLONE_ENABLED=1` (a real env var) only on a capable machine to show it.
- Optional Kokoro TTS sidecar (`kokoro-onnx`, ONNX/CPU, no PyTorch): installed by
  `tools/setup-kokoro.ps1` into `tools/kokoro-venv/` (gitignored) + model/voices.
  Auto-detected. It is an **opt-in** per-user engine (`/voice set engine:Kokoro`);
  gTTS stays the default for everyone and without the sidecar Kokoro serves gTTS.
- Optional STT sidecar (faster-whisper, no PyTorch/cmake): installed by
  `tools/setup-whisper.{sh,ps1}` into `tools/whisper-venv/` (gitignored). The bot
  auto-detects it (`resolveWhisperCmd`: `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows OR
  `bin/python` on Linux) — model `base` runs on the VPS (~2.2s per 13.6s of speech;
  see `docs/SPIKE-STT.md`). Powers `/transcribe` (voice→text, **Premium-gated +
  Manage-Guild**): consent-first per speaker (inline button → `stt_consent`), bot
  un-deafens only during a session, audio never persisted, transcripts are channel
  messages (disclosed in PRIVACY §2.4). Without the sidecar `/transcribe` replies
  "unavailable" (inert).

## Conventions

- TypeScript, `module: NodeNext`, `strict: true` (see `tsconfig.json`).
- Tests: vitest, flat files in `tests/` named after the module under test
  (e.g. `tests/playerFifo.test.ts` covers `src/voice/player.ts`).
- Commits: short conventional-ish one-liners in Portuguese (see `git log`).

## Testing — TDD is mandatory

Every code change goes through **test-driven development**: write the failing
test FIRST (RED), then the minimum code to pass it (GREEN), then refactor.
Never write production code before there is a test that fails without it.

- For logic covered by vitest (`src/**` TypeScript), this is literal: add/adjust
  the test in `tests/`, run it and see it fail, then implement.
- For code with no unit harness (static site in `site/`, browser JS), the
  executable acceptance test is the browser (preview): define the pass/fail
  criteria first, then verify against the running page — no CSP console errors,
  the flow works, etc. Don't ship site changes unverified.
- Always finish with the full suite green: `npm run check` (build + typecheck + lint +
  format:check + vitest, mirrors CI). Individually: `npx vitest run` + `npm run typecheck`.
